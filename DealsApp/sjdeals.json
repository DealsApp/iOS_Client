San Jose's The Dancing Cat is a creative space for people, and sometimes adoptable cats are able to get in on the human interaction. The space provides a living room-like ambiance where anywhere between seven and 11 lucky cats can wander and play in a cage-free environment. Visitors go there to meet friends, read, study or simply lounge with adoptable cats under a ceiling of colorful paper lanterns. Whether you're looking to adopt or just like to soak up the cool cat vibe and maybe scratch behind a few furry ears, this is one hour of your time that won't be wasted.",
